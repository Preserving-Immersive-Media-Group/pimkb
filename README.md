The Preserving Immersive Media Knowledge Base is a resource created to help share information between members of the digital preservation community who are caring for virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), 360 video, real-time 3D software and other similar materials. This site was born out of [Tate's Preserving Immersive Media Project](https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/projects/preserving-immersive-media) with funding from the [Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en). Since this project has it's roots in museum practice, there are many references to artworks, however we invite collaboration from all related practices!

The site is designed to be freeform, flexible and collaborative. If you are new here, these links might help steer you towards information of interest:

* Our guide to [getting started](broken-reference) with immersive media preservation.
* [Case studies](case-studies/your-case-study-here.md) of preservation work in practice.
* [Recording and notes](development-log.md) from Preserving Immersive Media Group events.

A longer read is the [white paper](https://www.tate.org.uk/file/preserving-virtual-reality-artworks) published as an output of Tate's immersive media research.&#x20;
