# üßê Open Questions

Preserving Immersive Media is an emerging area of digital preservation and presents us with many new challenges and opportunities for research. This page is a place for tracking the big questions that we have arrived at through research, discussion and daydreaming.&#x20;

### VR

* What are the most effective approaches to consistently capturing video documentation of VR experiences? Including field-of-view capture, video.
* What does the process of adding OpenXR support to an existing VR experience look like? Are there any changes that result?&#x20;
* Diagram of underlying technology of headsets

### 3D File Formats

* Which 3D file formats are suitable/sustainable for preservation purposes? Which are not?

### Tools

* Gap analysis of preservation tools - what is available, what could be developed?
* Calibration tools- comparison with game brightness etc&#x20;
* Capture tools&#x20;
* File format identification- do these support 3D Objects and 3D software?

### Documentation

* What is the relationship between the artwork and the technology, to what extent is the experience determined by an individual‚Äôs engagement with the peripheral devices, and to what extent might this be understood and managed over time?
* What non-technical frameworks exist to help us understand user experience?  Oral histories Historical context of technologies
* What combination of technical tools and non-technical frameworks might we employ to try to create a sustainable catalogue of user experience, and how might this feed into the historical records of an artwork?
* If an artwork is so complex as to become unsustainable, how might we interpret its documentation for a new audience?

### 360 Video

* Metadata standards?

### Meta

* How do we identify and deal with broken links in the future? GitBook doesn't offer this service, but could we use the GitHub repo (e.g. [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check))?
* How should we run the knowledge base in terms of welcoming contributions and granting access permissions?
