# ❓ Open Questions

The preservation of immersive media is an emerging topic in digital preservation and presents many new challenges and opportunities for research. This page is a place for tracking questions and prompts that we have arrived at through research, discussion and daydreaming. Do you think you can contribute an answer to any these or do you have any questions of your own? We'd love your [contribution](contributing.md)!

### VR

* What are the most effective approaches to consistently capturing video documentation of VR experiences? Including field-of-view capture, video etc.
* What does the process of adding OpenXR support to an existing VR experience look like? Are there any changes that result and how might these be managed?&#x20;
* Diagram and technical specs for underlying technology of headsets

### 3D File Formats

* Which 3D data file formats are most suitable/sustainable for preservation purposes? Are there any which are not?

### Tools

* Gap analysis of preservation tools - what is available, what could be developed?
* Calibration tools- comparison with game brightness etc&#x20;
* Capture tools&#x20;
* File format identification- do these support 3D Objects and 3D software?

### Acquisitions

* A complexity matrix- tool to enable advocacy for institutional resources&#x20;

### Documentation

* How can we navigate the relationship between the artwork and the technology, to what extent is the experience determined by an individual’s engagement with the peripheral devices, and to what extent might this be understood and managed over time?
* What non-technical frameworks exist to help us understand user experience? e.g. oral histories, historical context of technologies
* What combination of technical tools and non-technical frameworks might we employ to try to create a sustainable catalogue of user experience, and how might this feed into the historical records of an artwork?
* If an artwork is so complex as to become unsustainable, how might we interpret its documentation for a new audience?

### 360 Video

* What are the most appropriate metadata standards and how can they be applied?

### PIM Knowledge Base

* How do we identify and deal with broken links in the future? GitBook doesn't offer this service, but could we use the GitHub repo (e.g. [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check))?
* How should we run/support the knowledge base in terms of encouraging contributions? How might this play out in the long-term?&#x20;
