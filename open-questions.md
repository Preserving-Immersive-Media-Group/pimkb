# ❓ Open Questions

The preservation of immersive media (XR) remains an emerging topic in digital preservation and presents many new challenges and opportunities for research. This page is a place for tracking questions and prompts that we have arrived at through research, discussion and daydreaming. Is your work or research addressing any of these questions? Do you have any questions of your own? We would love to [hear from you](contributing.md)!

## Documentation

* What are the most effective approaches to consistently capturing video documentation of XR experiences? e.g. field-of-view capture, 360 degree video capture
  * How would one choose a capture tool? What are the benefits/limitations of specific tools?
* What non-technical frameworks exist to help us understand and transmit user experience? e.g. oral histories, historical context of technologies
* What combination of technical tools and non-technical frameworks might we employ to try to create a sustainable catalogue of user experience, and how might this feed into the historical records of an XR experience?

## Preservation

### XR Software&#x20;

* What does the process of adding OpenXR support to existing 3D software look like? Are there any risks of limitation to this process?&#x20;
* If an XR experience is so complex to preserve as to be unsustainable, can we support interpretation through documentation alone? See also Documentation above.

### XR Hardware

* Which XR hardware is the most sustainable? e.g. repairable, long-term support/updates
* Diagrams and/or technical specs for HMDs available or can they be derived from community analysis?&#x20;
* How do we navigate the relationship between the XR experience and the technologies used?&#x20;
  * To what extent is the experience determined by an individual’s engagement with the peripheral devices?&#x20;
  * To what extent might this be understood and managed over time?

### 3D File Formats

* Which 3D data file formats are most suitable/sustainable for preservation purposes? Are there any which are not?
* File format identification - to what extent do these currently support 3D objects?

### 360 Video

* What are the most appropriate metadata standards and how can they be applied?
* To what extent do existing metadata extraction tools (e.g. MediaInfo) support spatial metadata?&#x20;

### Tools

* Gap analysis of preservation tools - what is available, what could be developed?
* Calibration and/or instrumentation tools - can we achieve quantitative comparison of software/hardware properties? Can this be achieved cross-platform?&#x20;

## Knowledge Base

* How do we identify and deal with broken links in the future? GitBook doesn't offer this service, but could we use the GitHub repo (e.g. [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/broken-link-check))?
* How should we run/support the knowledge base in terms of encouraging contributions? How might this play out in the long-term?&#x20;
