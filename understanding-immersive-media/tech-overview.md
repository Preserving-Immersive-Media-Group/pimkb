# Introduction

Immersive media is a term used to describe a set of related technologies that aim to extend our physical reality in various ways. For [Virtual Reality (VR)](virtual-reality-vr.md), this means immersing a user in a virtual environment. For [Augmented Reality (AR)](augmented-reality-ar.md), this means integrating virtual elements with a physical environment. Together, VR, AR and other related terms, are sometimes referred to using the umbrella term XR.&#x20;

This section of the Knowledge Base presents a concise overview of the key technologies you are likely to encounter when working with immersive media and links out to other useful resources. XR content such as [360 video](360-video/) or [real-time 3D software](real-time-3d/) is the custom content that an individual or organisation might be interested in acquiring and preserving.&#x20;
