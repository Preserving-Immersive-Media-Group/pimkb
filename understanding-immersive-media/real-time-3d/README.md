# Real-Time 3D

Real-time 3D (RT3D) rendering is the process of generating moving images in real-time using software. In contrast to digital video, where a fixed number of frames are stored in a file, in real-time 3D frames are generated on-the-fly from 3D data sources. This allows the moving image to be dynamic and to respond to user interaction.&#x20;

## Real-Time 3D Engines

RT3D software can be developed from scratch, but is frequently built on an existing code base. In many cases this is what is known as an _engine_: a package of libraries and tools which simplify the development of RT3D software.&#x20;
