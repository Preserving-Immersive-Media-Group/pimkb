# XR Systems

There is a range of XR systems, from a simple and relatively inexpensive mobile phone used with a lensed viewing device (e.g. Google Cardboard) to complex integrated software/hardware systems with tracking features meant for full-body interactivity (e.g. HTC Vive).&#x20;

The simplest type of XR system uses a handheld mobile phone mount with lenses that help to focus on the screen content and create the illusion of an immersive view. The next step in features and complexity involves a [head-mounted display (HMD)](head-mounted-display.md) that is hands-free and provides a better illusion of immersion. Further interactivity and immersion is achieved with [tracking systems](tracking-system.md), which provide input for the [XR content](broken-reference) and/or information about the user's position in space. Tracking systems can be built into the HMD (usually 3DOF), or hardware such as handheld controllers or spatial tracking systems are used along with an HMD (usually 6DOF).&#x20;

Another category among XR systems is standalone types and tethered types. Standalone HMDs offer greater freedom of motion and are less expensive overall, while tethered systems use a connected computer to offer better performance in terms of graphics and location processing. Tracking is included in both standalone and tethered systems, but the degree of motion/position information and accuracy is variable.

Some examples of the main types of XR systems are:

* Handheld type
  * Google Cardboard
  * Samsung Gear
* Standalone type
  * Oculus Quest
  * HTC Vive Focus
* Tethered type
  * Oculus Rift
  * HTC Vive Pro

The commercial marketplace has strongly influenced development of XR systems since the early 2010's when a "second wave" of immersive technologies started. Most companies produce tiered feature sets at varying price points. Releases of product models might follow incremental improvements in technology, resulting in very similar systems with only one or two differences between them -- or releases could represent a big jump in technology or hardware design from year to year. It can be challenging to identify defining features and technical specifications for a given XR system because of advertising styles (many hard-to-prove claims are made) and the proprietary, competitive nature of development.

The table below is meant to gather information for the purpose of identifying the features of popular XR systems. It could be useful for considering compatibility in the case of a potential hardware replacement or migration. For example if the XR content uses 6DOF interactivity, an XR system that is only capable of supporting 3DOF would not be suitable.
