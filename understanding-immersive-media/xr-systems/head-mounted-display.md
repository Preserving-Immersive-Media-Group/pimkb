# Head-Mounted Display (HMD)

A head-mounted display (HMD) is a display device, worn on the head or as part of a helmet, that mounts either a single screen in front of both of the users eyes (monocular HMD) or a separate screen in front of each eye (binocular HMD). An extensive summary of the properties of VR HMDs is available on the [XinReality](https://xinreality.com/wiki/Virtual\_Reality\_Devices) wiki or on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_virtual\_reality\_headsets). HMD's are generally either "tethered" (such as Oculus Rift) to a PC that monitors tracking and undertakes the rendering, or "untethered" (such as Oculus Quest) where the unit is standalone.&#x20;
