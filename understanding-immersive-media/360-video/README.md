# 360° Video

360° video is a video format in which every direction of view is available to the viewer. Though the direction of view is free, in most circumstances the viewing position in space is either fixed or on a predetermined “on rails” path.&#x20;

360° video can be created in a number of different ways:

* Captured by a camera or array of camera lenses;
* Generated as an export from 3D rendering software (e.g. Blender);
* Generated from a real-time 3D [game engine](../game-engines/#list-of-engines). The 360° video exported from a game engine can be the artistic end product (s. for instance "[Passage Park #7: Relocate](../../community/)" by Studer / van den Berg) or the documentation of a real-time 3D artwork.&#x20;
