# 360 Video

360 video is a video format in which every direction of view is available to the viewer. Though the direction of view is free, in most circumstances the viewing position in space is either fixed or on a predetermined “on rails” path. 360 video is commonly either captured by a camera or array of camera lenses or generated as an export from a [game engine](../real-time-3d/#list-of-engines). The 360 video exported from the game engine can be the artistic end product (s. for instance "[Passage Park #7: Relocate](../../case-studies/your-case-study-here.md)" by Studer / van den Berg) or a documentation of the artwork.&#x20;
