# 🤝 Code of Conduct

## Document History

The first version of this Code of Conduct is based on that used by the [Wikibase Stakeholder Group](https://wbstakeholder.group/code-of-conduct#code-of-conduct). Future updates or alterations to the Code of Conduct should be noted here along with the date and actioner.

## Code of Conduct

The Preserving Immersive Media Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all (online and offline) Preserving Immersive Media Group spaces, including including mailing lists, online meetings, in-person meetings, the GitBook space, the GitHub repository. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the response team.

Some Preserving Immersive Media Group spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “_hug_” or “_backrub_”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

The Preserving Immersive Media Group prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The response team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### Reporting <a href="#reporting" id="reporting"></a>

If you are being harassed by a member of Preserving Immersive Media Group, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the [response team](code-of-conduct.md#consequences-1). If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to Preserving Immersive Media Group spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Preserving Immersive Media Group outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Preserving Immersive Media Group members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The response team reserves the right to exclude people from Preserving Immersive Media Group based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Preserving Immersive Media Group spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Preserving Immersive Media Group.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Preserving Immersive Media Group members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Consequences <a href="#consequences" id="consequences"></a>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Preserving Immersive Media Group spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Preserving Immersive Media Group members or the general public.
