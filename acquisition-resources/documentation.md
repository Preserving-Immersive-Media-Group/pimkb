## **Acquisition Information Template**

This document was designed to guide information gathering and discussion during the early stages of the acquisition of a virtual reality (VR) artwork, primarily with conservation and long-term preservation in mind. It is designed to be completed by or in close collaboration with an artist prior to receiving media from the artist.

There are two versions of the template:&#x20;

* Version 1 (March 2019) developed by Jack McConchie and Tom Ensom during Tate's Preserving Immersive Media project:  [https://www.tate.org.uk/file/virtual-reality-artwork-acquisition-information-template](https://www.tate.org.uk/file/virtual-reality-artwork-acquisition-information-template)
* Version 2 (May 2019) developed as an extension of this template by Savannah Campbell and Mark Hellar: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGHHvxMRQc\_OQYjHFW1mTMRa2vL9MGsjiNq1gF4j6l8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGHHvxMRQc\_OQYjHFW1mTMRa2vL9MGsjiNq1gF4j6l8/edit?usp=sharing)
