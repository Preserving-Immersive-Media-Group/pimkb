## **Acquisition Information Templates**

These documents were designed to guide information gathering and discussion during the early stages of the acquisition of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) artworks, primarily with conservation and long-term preservation in mind. They are designed to be completed by or in close collaboration with an artist prior to receiving media from the artist.
