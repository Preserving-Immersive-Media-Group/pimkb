# ☑ Acquisition Checklist (Draft)

Acquiring XR materials and experiences is a complex process and involves navigating many uncertainties regarding the future of the technologies involved. This checklist, while not exhaustive, is designed to assist navigating this process by highlighting key activities and questions to consider.&#x20;

For **all XR** materials and experiences:

* Work closely with the creator and/or their team to understand the components of the XR experience and document what is learnt during this process — see [Documentation Templates](documentation-templates.md).
* Understand the way in which the XR experience has been presented in the past and gather any relevant documentation to support this.&#x20;
* Assess how immediate the need for access to display equipment is and source anything missing. This might include:&#x20;
  * XR equipment (e.g. HMD, tracking system...) — at least one set.
  * Computer system suitable for running the software and hardware.
  * Additional screen(s) for setup and monitoring.

If any **computers** are being supplied ensure you have:

* Created disk images of any internal storage media.
* Create a backup machine (if viewed as useful for display).
* Tested them to ensure they function.
* Documented their hardware components.
* Extracted any relevant components for archiving (e.g. the [XR runtime](software-archiving-guides/archiving-an-xr-runtime.md)).

If any **real-time 3D software** is being supplied ensure you have:

* Received executable software (ideally supporting as many operating systems and XR runtimes as possible).
* Identified, gathered and tested dependencies required to access the executable software (e.g. operating systems, libraries, XR runtime, drivers).
* Received source materials (be it code or an engine project) required to build the project — see [Software Archiving Guides](software-archiving-guides/).
* Identified, gathered and tested dependencies required to access source materials.

If any **360 video** is being supplied ensure you have:

*
