# Repair Guides

Extending the service life of hardware through repair could support preservation efforts if a particular XR system is required. These hardware systems are meant to be used, and in an exhibition context they can be subjected to serious wear and tear.

The consumer market for VR hardware systems and mobile phones is built on planned obsolescence; products are superseded by new models, manufacturers only provide limited warranty periods for repair or replacement, and parts are not commonly available. Purchasing backup equipment or sourcing equipment to be used for parts may be part of a preservation plan.

iFixit is a US-based company that advocates for repairability of consumer devices. The Preserving Immersive Media Knowledge Base has no affiliation with iFixit. The guides linked here provide step-by-step instructions with photos, as well as tools and in some cases replacement parts. The teardown reviews are another resource should you have equipment that is intended to be used for parts. Popular XR systems and Samsung Gear VR are linked here, but many other device guides can be found on iFixit.
