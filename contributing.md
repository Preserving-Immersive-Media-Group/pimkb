# ✍️ Contributing

The Knowledge Base in a collaborative and community-driven space for sharing anything from publications, to technical guides, to notes and work-in-progress. We welcome contributions big or small!

As a contributor, you agree to the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) and that any content you create on this GitBook site will be shared according to our [Licence](licence.md) terms.

If you contribute, please do add your name to the [list of contributors](contributors/) and create a bio page!&#x20;

### How to Contribute

If you are interested in contributing, you can join the team as an Editor by following this link:&#x20;

[https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MiR-vfqFP7-QsvY8wdc/b20bJHyul40s6q8KYlI9](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MiR-vfqFP7-QsvY8wdc/b20bJHyul40s6q8KYlI9)

Once you have logged in and joined the PIMKB group on GitBook, you will be able to make edits to pages:

1. You can start editing by clicking on the 'Edit' button in the top right corner. Changes you make in Edit mode will exist independently from the live version until you submit them for review.
2. Add a brief description of the changes made during your edit by filling in the 'Describe your changes...' field at the top of the page. This will help the reviewer understand the nature of your changes.
3. Once you are happy with your edit, click the 'Submit for review' button in the top right corner. Your edit will then be checked by an administrator before going live.&#x20;

For more information on GitBook and how to use it, check out the [GitBook docs](https://docs.gitbook.com/).
