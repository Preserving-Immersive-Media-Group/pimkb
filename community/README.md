## Preserving Immersive Media Group

The Preserving Immersive Media Group (PIMG) is a community and email list for those interested in collecting, preserving and stabilising artworks that utilise immersive media, including 360 video, real-time 3D, virtual reality and augmented reality. This group was born out of the ongoing [Preserving Immersive Media](https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/projects/preserving-immersive-media) project at Tate. \
\
We encourage all with an interest in these topics to join the PIMG email list on [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/pimg). Members are welcome participate in discussion and to share any relevant information via the list, providing they agree to the PIMG [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).

PIMG also runs regular events, recordings and outputs from which are [made available online](past-pimg-events.md).&#x20;

## List of Immersive Media Artworks

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a growing list maintained by the community. If you care for an immersive media artwork, please consider adding it.
{% endhint %}

The purpose of this list is to show the variety of artworks and technologies used, but also to foster exchange between conservators. The listed artworks are _not_ necessarily well documented case studies. In the list below not only VR- or AR-based artworks are included, but also other interactive artworks that are produced with a game engine and hence require similar preservation strategies.
